# Exercise Program Summary

## Motion Analysis Overview
The IMU data analysis report showed positive bilateral coordination and movement patterns. The left and right hands performed up-down movements simultaneously, and movements were smooth and consistent. However, there was a noticeable difference in the range of motion between the left and right hands, with the left hand showing a larger range. This will be targeted for improvement in the exercise routine.

## 10-Day Exercise Program

| Day | Data Observed | Data Pattern | Phase | Exercise/Routine Name | Day Duration | VR Game Script |
|-----|--------------|--------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1   | Pitch range: -44.76939 to 6.828043 (LH), -32.10972 to 6.62468 (RH) | Simultaneous up-down, LH larger range | Baseline Assessment | Mirror Motion Training | 20 minutes | Follow the movement of virtual hands in the mirrors, matching their height and speed |
| 2   | Left hand lags by 0.2s | Synchronized up-down, slight lag in LH | Coordination Training | Synchronized Hand Raises | 25 minutes | Catch virtual balloons floating upwards with both hands raised in sync |
| 3   | Pitch range: 51.6 (LH), 38.7 (RH) | LH larger range, steady acceleration | Strength Building | Peak Hold Challenge | 30 minutes | Reach for virtual fruit hanging over the player, with a higher range earning more points |
| 4   | Roll and Yaw variations minimal | Maintains orientation during movement | Speed Development | Tempo-Based Lifts | 35 minutes | Lift virtual weights to the beat of a song, points awarded for keeping to tempo |
| 5   | Smooth acceleration/deceleration | Consistent movement patterns | Endurance Training | Rhythm Climbers | 40 minutes | Climb a virtual wall by moving hands up and down to grab climbing holds |
| 6   | No abrupt changes in gyro data | Control over movements, smoothness | Recovery/Light | Gentle Waves | 30 minutes | Create waves in a virtual pond by moving hands up and down |
| 7   | Synchronized timestamps, LH larger range | Good coordination, needs improvement in symmetry | Advanced Integration | Symmetry Swimmers | 45 minutes | Swim through a virtual underwater course by moving both hands up and down simultaneously |
| 8   | Constant speed and acceleration (gyro data) | Consistent speed, controlled acceleration | Strength Building | Power Pushers | 40 minutes | Push away virtual walls with both hands, earning points for the strength and speed of push |
| 9   | Roll and Yaw variations minimal | Maintains orientation during movement | Speed Development | Quick Hitters | 35 minutes | Hit virtual drums in an up-down motion, earning points for hitting speed and maintaining hand orientation |
| 10  | Smooth acceleration/deceleration, no jerky movements | Control over movements, smoothness | Recovery/Light | Cloud Soothers | 30 minutes | Soothe virtual clouds by waving hands up and down gently |

## Progress Tracking
- **Initial Metrics**: Range of motion, synchronization, smoothness, strength, and speed.
- **Target Metrics**: Increased range of motion for the right hand, synchronization within 0.1s, smoother transitions, and faster and stronger movements.
- **Success Criteria**: If the target metrics are met, the individual has successfully completed the exercise program.
- **Progression Rules**: If the individual meets the success criteria, they can progress to more advanced exercises.

## Exercise Instructions
For each exercise, follow the virtual instructor's movements. Ensure your movements are smooth and controlled, and aim for synchronization between both hands. Avoid any sudden or jerky movements.

## Safety Guidelines
Always start with a 5-minute warm-up and end with a 5-minute cool-down. Take a 2-minute rest between each set. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise immediately.

## Next Steps
After completing the 10-day exercise routine, the individual should continue practicing the exercises to maintain their improved bilateral coordination and range of motion. They can also progress to more advanced exercises under the guidance of a physiotherapist.
